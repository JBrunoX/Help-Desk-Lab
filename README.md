Welcome to my Help Desk Lab. This lab was created to simulate a help desk environment. Feel free to follow along and change anything to your liking.
I want this to act as a playground for aspiring help desk technicians!

This page will be used as a Table of Contents with links to different lab sections.

# Table of Contents

### [00: Installation Steps](https://github.com/JBrunoX/Help-Desk-Lab/blob/main/Installation.md)
### [01: Add Users, Groups & GPOs](https://github.com/JBrunoX/Help-Desk-Lab/blob/main/Add%20Users%2C%20Groups%20%26%20GPOs.md)
### [02: Add a Computer to the Domain](#add-computers-to-the-domain)
- Here, we need a VM or physical machine with Windows 11 Pro / Enterprise. We will download Enterprise for this simulation since it will give us a free 90-day trial.

### [03: Implement and Apply GPOs](https://github.com/JBrunoX/Help-Desk-Lab/blob/main/Implement%20and%20Apply%20GPOs.md)
- We will put the GPOs we previously created into effect.
### [04: Set Up Network Sharing & Permissions](https://github.com/JBrunoX/Help-Desk-Lab/blob/main/Set%20Up%20Network%20Sharing%20%26%20Permissions.md)
- We will begin setting up our file-sharing structure. This will allow us to share various files and folders across our domain. We will also ensure the correct permissions are put in place.
### [04: Setting Up FSRM (File Server Resource Manager)](https://github.com/JBrunoX/Help-Desk-Lab/blob/main/Setting%20Up%20FSRM%20(File%20Server%20Resource%20Manager.md)
- FSRM will be used to manage and classify the data stored on our file server. We will notify users when folders are getting full and to clean up their storage to prevent full disks.
